<h1>🚗 Arduino Bluetooth Controlled Car </h1>
  
This project demonstrates how to build and control a simple car using an Arduino board, a Bluetooth controller (HC-05), a motor driver, and the Dabble mobile app. Our team designed and assembled this car to be controlled wirelessly via a smartphone using Bluetooth communication.
